# Kriforfab

Kriforfab is a port of some important features from the Fabric API like the Biome API to Forge and in the future NeoForge.
This library makes it easier to make mods that are compatible with Forge and Fabric.

Here are some of the features:

- Fabric API Base
- Fabric Biome API v1
- Forge object registration limits are removed with this library!
- And a few other features!

# How to setup?
I will soon write how to use it in your mod projects, but for now it is an experimental project.
