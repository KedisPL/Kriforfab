# Kriforfab

Kriforfab is a port of some important features from the Fabric API like the Biome API to NeoForge.
This library makes it easier to make mods that are compatible with NeoForge and Fabric.

Here are some of the features:

- Fabric API Base
- Fabric Biome API v1
- Forge and NeoForge registration limits are removed with this library!
- And a few other features!

# How to setup?
Maybe I will write how to use it in your mod projects when it comes out of alpha, but for now it is an experimental project.
